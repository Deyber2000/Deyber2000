### I'm honored you're visiting my GitHub! :octocat:

Let me introduce myself:
I'm a Full Software Developer passionate about solving problems using good practices. My current focus is to build big software solutions to common problems. Always trying to develop solutions with a serverless architectures approach.



Allow me to show you around:

ðŸ‘‡ I've pinned the six repositories that most closely reflect my development skills. One is a personal project, the other are projects built while improving my software skills studying at [Holberton School](https://holbertonschool.com).
